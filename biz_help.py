•	This is a conversational assessment and prioritization exercise with Upstage AI. We're excited about the amazing opportunities that Upstage AI has to look forward to, pending execution and development.
•	Basic overview of US Launch components for Upstage AI across the next 30-60-90-180. Considering the early stage of Upstage AI in the US Market, most items (ie: Channel Development et al. will be 2025 initiatives).
•	These are general thoughts that need to be prioritized and customized with Upstage AI leadership
•	Additional considerations need to be added
•	Granular process outlines are addressed via separate cover

Baseline Q&A
Prioritization Exercise with Upstage AI Leadership:
1.	Define Top Line Sales Targets – or – new Customer Acquisition Targets for the US Market
a.	Existing Customer Data:
•	Number of customers
•	Revenue per customer
•	Sales cycle?
•	Geographic distribution?
•	By Product / Solution
•	How many named/branded solutions do you have?
b.	Using APJ numbers for reference, calculate historical initial revenue per sale (which will aggressively scale as we build this out and progress).
c.	What is your target revenue in the US Market for years 1,2,3?
d.	Work backwards from the number and define the quantity of new opportunities needed
e.	Average across quarter and month to establish monthly targets

2.	Company Headcount (by geo)
a.	Customer Facing: Sales & Sales Engineering
b.	Solution Implementation Post Sales and ongoing Customer Success / Expansion
c.	Customer Service
d.	Back End Developers
e.	Technical Support
f.	Senior Leadership
g.	Do you offer Services? Implementation, Foundation Model Training, Fine Tuning? Ongoing MSP?
h.	Subscription based Managed Services (MSP)? Let's discuss and a GenAI MSP business as a key opportunity for ARR and Industry Leadership opportunities. 

3.	Capacity Assessment: Opportunity & Customer Load

f.	US specific to current staffing in place:
•	How many of the following can you concurrently manage today?
•	Customers (customer success, customer service and tech support)
•	Open Opportunities?
•	New Implementations?
g.	NEXT STEP: Compare topline revenue and customer targets + HC targets to these numbers? Work backwards to find the balance.

4.	Clearly Defined Product & Revenue Streams
a.	Current solutions on AWS: OCR, LM, ASKUP.
b.	Are you familiar with the OCR marketplace in the US? Have you assessed it? What specific solutions are you looking to drive in the US market for Day #1 GTM?
c.	What do you envision as your product market fit in the US?
d.	NOTE: Best play in US may be foundationally, and finely tuned Language Models, bundled with services and discreet product sets?

e.	Do you envision selling both models and industry/trained/fine-tuned solutions?
f.	How do you calculate go to market pricing? How do you reassess and refine? Are you indexing on margin, volume or seeking a balance?

Crafting Effective Messaging & Benefit Statements
1. Value of Clear, Concise Benefit Statements
•	Why They Matter:
o	People care about how you're relevant to their needs, goals, and objectives. Everyone's tuned into WIIFM.com: "What's in it for me?" We need to answer this internal question within 10-15 seconds to earn their attention for further discussion.
o	Benefit statements translate features into customer value, helping them see how your product solves their specific problems. They help customers visualize the benefits they'll receive from what you offer, breaking through preoccupation and grabbing their attention.
o	They position you as a potential subject matter expert—someone worth meeting.
o	You should maintain a repository of well-crafted statements for all buyer personas and industry-specific solutions you offer, including longer, balanced statements that cover all buyer types. Use these based on the situation: press releases, media engagements, presentations, elevator pitches, industry events.
o	Lacking crisp, relevant, and attractive statements for all buyer personas and applicable industry use cases puts you at an immediate disadvantage and can lead to potential failure.
•	Differentiate Between Features and Benefits:
o	Feature: A factual statement about a product (e.g., "Solar LLM can run on a single GPU").
o	Benefit: What the feature means to the customer (e.g., "Reduces your hardware costs while delivering high performance, all while keeping it secure in your own environment").
o	Key Point: Few people buy based on features alone; they seek solutions that meet their needs and objectives. People are looking for solutions to their problems.
o	Avoid Feature Dumps: Steer clear of this approach as it detracts value and commoditizes your offering.
2. Step-by-Step Guide to Crafting Benefit Statements
•	Step 1: Key Non-Negotiables
o	Use quantifiable data whenever possible. Contrast to norms, competition, common challenges, and problems all customers face. Be brief, clear, and concise.
o	Be prepared to "stack" benefit statements in succession. Provide relevant Statement #1, ask an open-ended question about their challenges or goals, and follow up conversationally with additional statements that align with their response or add more contextual benefits. This dialogue opens up a functional needs analysis.
•	Step 2: Understand & Define Customer Pain Points
o	Identify the challenges and limitations customers face in solving their problems with current solutions and providers—be as specific as possible. Ask yourself:
	What challenges do our customers face that Upstage AI's features and solutions address?
	If I were in my customer's shoes, how would I feel about the GenAI space? What would confuse me in selecting a GenAI solution?
	What risks are my customers or prospects facing? How will we preemptively address those concerns?
	What's the state of today's GenAI marketplace? Is there ambiguity? What are the biggest concerns—pricing, resource requirements, security, privacy?
	How does Upstage AI solve these issues and more?
•	Step 3: Identify Key Features & Benefits of Upstage AI
o	List the core features of Upstage AI products and solutions, both broadly and for specific industries.
•	Step 4: Formulate 30-40 Benefit Statements
o	Use a formula: Feature + What It Does + Why It Matters + Data (if possible). For example, "The Solar LLM runs efficiently on a single GPU, lowering operational costs while maintaining high processing speed."
o	Review, edit, and combine different pieces to create compelling, multi-layered value propositions that cover multiple bases.
o	Continuously refine, role-play with your team, and document them in an iterative database on a shared drive.
o	Note: A comprehensive list of starting points is provided at the end of this document.
3. Interactive Workshop Activity: Crafting Benefit Statements (If Time Permits)
•	Group Exercise:
o	Divide leadership into small teams. Provide a list of features and have them craft benefit statements based on identified customer needs.
•	Review and Feedback:
o	Each group presents their benefit statements. Facilitate a discussion on which statements are most compelling and why.
•	Refinement Session:
o	Encourage teams to refine their statements based on feedback, focusing on clarity, customer-centric language, and alignment with known customer needs.
4. Final Wrap-Up
•	Discuss Key Takeaways:
o	Emphasize the importance of using customer insights to craft compelling benefit statements.
•	Next Steps:
o	Set a deadline for creating your general, technical, non-technical, and industry-specific feature and benefit statements.
o	Schedule time for iteration and modification.
